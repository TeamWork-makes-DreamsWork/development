##Description
  A project where we used Ruby on Rails and Front End Engineering(FEE) to create a Stack Overflow competitor called Stack Undertow. Rails was tasked with creating the API, then deploy to Heroku while FEE was tasked with consuming the API while deploying on Firebase.

##Objectives
  This app will be able to set up users who can create questions or answers and then accept their preferred answers. Members can then vote up or down on the questions or answers to bring them to the top of the page.

  This app has been a learning tool for both Rails and FEE. We have learned to collaborate to build and API that works well with what the FEE students needed.

  The Rails students were able to build a ReSTful API to support a range of features that is able to provide data to a reactive UI.

  FEE students were able to contribute to the database and Domain Model by writing a User Interface for API specifications. This was helpful in gaining experience writing reactive UIs with Angular JS.
